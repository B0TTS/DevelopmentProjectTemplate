ASCII Diagram Creator
Overview
This skill is a visual generator agent that creates clear, terminal-compatible ASCII diagrams to communicate system changes, migrations, and architectural decisions. It analyzes your context, selects the appropriate diagram type, generates the diagram, and refines based on feedback.

Key Capabilities:

Codebase auto-discovery: Automatically scan project structure, detect architecture patterns, and populate diagrams
Project-type templates: Pre-built templates for Bulletproof React, Next.js, Express, Monorepos
Context-aware diagram selection: Automatically choose the best diagram type for your use case
Professional ASCII formatting: Box-drawing characters, arrows, and status indicators
Diagram versioning: Metadata tracking for diagram freshness and staleness detection
Mermaid export: Convert ASCII diagrams to Mermaid syntax for graphical rendering
Git-aware staleness detection: Automatically flag outdated diagrams based on file changes
PR template integration: Auto-include relevant diagrams in pull request descriptions
CLAUDE.md directive setup: Optionally configure proactive diagram suggestions
Iterative refinement: Adjust width, alignment, and content based on feedback
Five diagram types: Architecture, Before/After, Phased Migration, Data Flow, Relationship/Synergy
Terminal-compatible: 80-character max width, works in any terminal/markdown
When to Use This Skill
Trigger Phrases:

"create an ascii diagram" / "make a text diagram"
"create a diagram showing..."
"visualize this architecture"
"show how X connects/synergizes/relates"
"diagram the workflow/phases/flow"
"illustrate the relationships between"
"show before and after"
Use PROACTIVELY when:

User is planning a major refactoring or migration
User is restructuring directories or file organization
User needs to communicate system changes in a PR description
User is explaining architecture to team members
User mentions "show me", "visualize", or "diagram"
Do NOT use when:

User wants graphical/image output (use Mermaid or external tools)
User needs flowcharts with complex branching (consider Mermaid)
User is asking about code, not structure or flow
Simple lists would suffice instead of visual diagrams
Response Style
Visual Generator Agent: Analyze context to determine what needs visualization, select appropriate diagram type, generate ASCII diagram, and refine through iteration.

Execution Pattern:

Analyze context: Understand what the user wants to visualize
Select diagram type: Choose Architecture, Before/After, Phased, or Data Flow
Generate diagram: Create initial diagram with proper formatting
Present with explanation: Show diagram and explain visual elements
Refine on request: Adjust based on user feedback ("make it wider", "add status")
MANDATORY - Output & Integration: Execute Phase 4 completely:
Offer Mermaid export for graphical rendering
Run staleness detection if existing diagrams found
Offer PR integration if user is working on a PR
Ask about CLAUDE.md directive setup
Output completion checklist (see below)
CRITICAL: The skill is NOT complete until the Completion Checklist is output.

Phase	Description	Details

1	Diagram Type Selection	→ workflow/phase-1-diagram-selection.md
2	Diagram Generation	→ workflow/phase-2-generation.md

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Phase 4 must ALWAYS be executed. Do not consider the skill complete until you have offered all integration options and output the completion checklist.

Quick Reference
Diagram Types
Type	Purpose	Best For
Architecture	System components and relationships	Showing how modules connect
Before/After	Compare current vs proposed state	Migration plans, refactoring
Phased Migration	Step-by-step progression	Multi-phase projects
Data Flow	How data moves through system	API flows, pipelines
Relationship/Synergy	How elements interact or complement	SDLC phases, skill workflows, team structures
Visual Elements
Category	Elements	Usage
Box Drawing	┌─┬─┐ │ │ │ ├─┼─┤ └─┴─┘	Component boundaries
Arrows	──► ◄── ◄─► ──✗ ──✓	Relationships, flow
Status	✓ ✗ ⏳ 🔄 ⚠️ 🔴	Progress indicators
Formatting Rules
Rule	Value	Reason
Max width	80 characters	Terminal compatibility
Box alignment	Vertical centers	Visual clarity
Spacing	Between sections	Readability
Legends	When using symbols	Self-documenting
Diagram Versioning
Add metadata to track diagram freshness and enable staleness detection:

<!-- diagram-meta
  type: architecture
  created: 2025-01-23
  last-verified: 2025-01-23
  source-patterns: [src/features/*, src/app/routes/*]
  stale-after: 30d
-->
Metadata Fields:

Field	Purpose
type	Diagram type (architecture, data-flow, etc.)
created	Initial creation date
last-verified	Last time diagram was confirmed accurate
source-patterns	Glob patterns of directories diagram represents
stale-after	Days until diagram should be re-verified
Staleness Detection: When files matching source-patterns are modified after stale-after days from last-verified, the diagram should be re-verified.
